## AUTOMATED TESTING

The Automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by test code like Jest, W3C HTML, and CSS validation.

### ¬†W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [Index Page HTML](assets/images/readme/htmlvalidation.png) - Pass
* [CSS validation](assets/images/readme/cssvalidation.png) - Pass

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

* Index Page mobile view

I think even for playing the game for the first time the user goals are pretty much the same than the returning and frequently returning user's goals therefore I will do the manual testing against the 5 user goals.

| Goals | How are they achieved? | Image |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| To navigate in the menu. | I have achieved this by creating a menu system | [menu system](assets/images/readme/desktopmainmenu.png)
| To play the game with no issues. | I have made the game fully functioning with no bugs  | [gameplay](assets/images/readme/desktopplayarea.png) |
| To have fun by trying to complete it within the least amount of time.| I achieved this by measuring the time and saving the username , time into the localstorage and display it in the highscore menu | [gameplay](assets/images/readme/ingamescreenshot.png) |

### Full Testing

Full testing can be tedious, so it is great to try and break this part up into smaller chunks and do a bit at a time. Full testing is when you go through the site and test every single thing that can be tested. So for example you would test that all links in the navbar correctly redirect the user to where there are supposed to go. A table is the perfect way to display this information.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

### Solved Bugs

üë©üèª‚ÄçüíªView an example of a completed bugs section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#BUGS)

This is where all solved bugs go once squashed. List what the bug was, and how you managed to fix it. You can also include images/videos here if you wanted.
