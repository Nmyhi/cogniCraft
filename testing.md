## AUTOMATED TESTING

The automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by test code like jest, W3C HTML, and CSS validation.

The jest test is to Follow!

### Â W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

* [Index Page HTML](assets/images/readme/htmlvalidation.png) - Pass

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
